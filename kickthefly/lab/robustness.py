"""How much do this simulation's results depend on the reconstruction being right?

Two manipulations, one question. Both re-run the validation suite's behaviors on a changed connectome and report
which of them still pass:

  threshold_sweep    drop every connection reconstructed with fewer than N synapses, for a range of N, and report
                     the threshold at which each validated behavior breaks. A behavior that survives a high
                     threshold does not rest on weak, possibly spurious contacts.
  signflip_trials    flip the sign of neurons whose neurotransmitter prediction the dataset is least sure about,
                     over repeated randomized trials, and report how often each behavior survives, with a survival
                     rate and its 95% Wilson interval and the unperturbed run of the same seeds as the control.

Both use the validation suite's own pass criteria (validation.py), unchanged, so "breaks" means the same thing here
as on the validation dashboard. The runs are lockstep and seeded, so the same sweep gives the same answer twice.

The connectome supplies the synapse counts and the neurotransmitter predictions with their confidences. Which
thresholds to try, how many flip trials to run and how many seeds to average over are this game's choices, and the
brain pack is already filtered to connections of at least 3 synapses by the loader, so a threshold of 1-3 changes
nothing at all.
